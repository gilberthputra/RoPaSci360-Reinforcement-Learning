# RoPaSci360 Reinforcement Learning
> Game Project for COMP30024 Universtiy of Melbourne  Semester 1, 2021.
> NOTE: This is just additional project for me to learn (NOT MARKED). The original solution made for the project can be found at https://github.com/gilberthputra/RoPaSci360.git

## TODO:
- Add additional moves function in the game engine
- Add update function in the game engine
- Implement a render environment by using a GUI
- Add reset function in the game engine
- Try to just train using PPO2 against original solution,
- then add a self-play wrapper
